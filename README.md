# Simple Todo App

As the name suggests, this is a simple application to track a To Do list. The user can click '+ Add Todo' and input a task name and optional date.

## Functionality

The name and date of the task appear on the To Do list. The item can be deleted and/or checked off. The appearance of a checked off item may have greater user satisfaction than just deleting the item when completing the task.

The app also includes a counter to support productivity by way of counting tasks completed.

## Technology

The app was created with starter HTML, CSS, and procedural Javascript. The Javascript was refactored using Object-Oriented programming with a modualar structure for the files.

Give a description of the technologies and techniques used. Pictures, GIFs, or screenshots that detail the project features are recommended.
